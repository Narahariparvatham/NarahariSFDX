Hi {!npe5__Affiliation__c.npe5__Contact__c},

We are writing to let you know we have been informed of a change in your relationship with {!npe5__Affiliation__c.npe5__Organization__c}. This is important to note because it may affect your LTA Membership.

A change in relationship is usually because you are no longer a member of your Venue. This change can be made either by yourself via the &apos;Member&apos;s Home&apos; area or alternatively by your affiliated venue.

If this change hasn’t been made by yourself and you believe this has been done in error, you should contact your venue directly to discuss this.

You can also find further information on how to manage your affiliated venues by following the steps outlined in our Help and FAQs.

If you are a Lite Member and no longer linked to any other Venue, your LTA Membership will expire on 31 January 2021.

Please note, if your membership does expire, you can re-join at any time via your Member&apos;s Area.
