    <textOnly>Hi {!npe5__Affiliation__c.npe5__Contact__c},

A web administrator at {!npe5__Affiliation__c.npe5__Organization__c} has issued you with access to the Place to Play Administrator Area for your venue.

The Place to Play is the management tool that allows you to complete LTA Venue Registration. Youâ€™re able to login to the Place to Play Area via your LTA Membership login page, using your usual username and password.

Once this is complete, you&apos;re able to update information about your venue, manage your LTA Membership list, update the contact details of your coaches and volunteers and most importantly promote your facilities and programmes on the main LTA website.

If you have any questions please contact your local County Office or the LTA Services team at info@lta.org.uk or 0208 487 7000.
